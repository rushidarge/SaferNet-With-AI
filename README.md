# SaferNet-With-AI

Nowadays on social networks where everyone can upload whatever they want without having to count that there might be children watching that or people don't want to watch that. To avoid this we need to come up with a solution that filters based real-time and with high accuracy using chrome extension that filters real-time NSFW (not safe for working) images and replaces them with SFW (safe for working) images.
Nowadays, on social networks where everyone can upload whatever they want without having to count that there might be children watching that or people don't want to watch that.
The government has definitely taken a step in this direction by blocking some websites, but what about social media sites? They are openly showing NSFW (not safe for work) content on their sites. We can avoid that content using artificial intelligence.
We can use some advanced computer vision techniques to filter out that content. We cannot access social media servers and block content for everyone, but we can add filters on the user side. To add a filter between a website and a user, we can simply use a browser extension, so we can filter content with very low latency, and it is also easy to deploy by using JavaScript.
Market share of WebÂ BrowsersSo there are multiple browsers in the market, but from all the market share, Chrome single-handedly captures 63.3% of the market share. It is very beneficial and to reach more users, we decided to build a Chrome Browser Extension.
